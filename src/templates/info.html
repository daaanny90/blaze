    <h2>What is this site?</h2>
    <p>
      Blaze is an ultrafast search engine. The purpose of Blaze is to minimize
      the transferred data between clients and servers, allowing users to
      navigate the web in a minimalist manner.
    </p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      One day, I exceeded my monthly data limit for high-speed browsing. As a
      consequence, my internet speed was significantly reduced. Consequently,
      web pages took an extremely long time to load, and I encountered timeout
      errors 90% of the time. It was at that moment that I contemplated a
      solution to this issue and conceived the idea of Blaze. Now, I can surf
      the web super fast and access the information I need even without a
      high-speed connection.
    </p>
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>
      It's actually very straightforward. When you click on "BLAZE IT!", the URL
      changes to https://blaze.cyclic.app?q= followed by the query you searched
      for. This address is where the backend is hosted. When the site is
      accessed with the "q" parameter, a simple Node.js application retrieves
      the search results and generates an extremely lightweight version of SERP
      (Search Engine Results Page). From there, if you click on a link, it will
      be parsed and a page will be generated with only the content (I used the
      same library that Firefox uses to generate the reader mode). This makes it
      possible to navigate using only a few kilobytes of data instead of
      megabytes. <br /><br />If you are offline yopu can see the pages you
      already visited, and also if you are online, those pages will be cached
      and blazing fast. <br /><br />If you want a more detailed explanantion on
      how Blaze works under the hood, I suggest you to
      <a href="https://github.com/daaanny90/blaze-this-page"
        >check the gitub repo</a
      >
      (if you have a fast connection).
    </p>
    <h2>Does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, even with a poor internet connection, you can search for things and
      load pages extremely quickly. When you click on "BLAZE IT!" and select a
      search result, you receive a webpage that is only a few kilobytes in size
      instead of several megabytes. This makes it possible to load the page even
      under challenging connection conditions, effectively preventing timeout
      errors from occurring. Moreover with the offline and caching support, the
      pages you already visited throug Blaze will be... blazing fast.
    </p>
    <h2>Other implications</h2>
    <p>
      This project was born to address an issue with slow internet connections
      while allowing continuous web surfing. During development, I discovered
      several other positive implications. Browsing a lightweight and
      minimalistic web puts less stress on the phone's battery and processor. It
      is mostly free from ads, and it likely has other, albeit possibly minor,
      impacts on the environment (e.g., reduced battery drain, decreased need
      for frequent phone charging, and lower CO2 emissions). Moreover, Blaze can
      serve as an "emergency search engine" for browsing the web in challenging
      connection situations, and it can even be a lifesaver at times.
